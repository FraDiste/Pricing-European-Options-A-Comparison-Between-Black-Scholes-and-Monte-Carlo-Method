# Pricing-European-Options-A-Comparison-Between-Black-Scholes-and-Monte-Carlo-Method
Comparison between the analytical Black–Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulation for pricing European options, with analysis of accuracy, convergence, and sensitivity to volatility.

This project compares two fundamental approaches to European option pricing: the analytical Black–Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulation. 
Implemented in Python, it illustrates how both methods can be applied to compute call and put option prices, highlighting differences in accuracy, convergence, and sensitivity to volatility. 
While Black–Scholes provides an elegant closed-form solution, Monte Carlo offers a flexible simulation-based alternative that approaches the theoretical value as the number of simulations increases.
The repository includes code, figures, and a report that explains the theoretical background and presents numerical results.
